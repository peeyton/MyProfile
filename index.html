    				<h2>Introduction</h2>
    			</header>

			  <p>I am Australian with some Italian bloodlines. I have always lived in North-East Victoria. I love living in the country.
          Throughout my schooling years I learned a little Italian, Japanese and Indonesian. However, the best I can do is to count to 10 in each language now.
          I have a gorgeous Siberian Husky, Nora. She is a handful and very cute!
          I really enjoy four-wheel driving, camping, music concerts and festivals (mainly metal/rock) and watching TV.</p>

          </header>

				<section>
					<h4>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interested? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h4>
          <p>Being 23 years of age, I have grown up using technology my whole life.
            I have always been interested in the use of computers and apps and I am particularly interested in learning how these work and what is involved in making them run.
            Programming is also an area that I am very interested in learning.</p>

          <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT</h4>
          <p>I chose RMIT as my education provider for the Bachelor of Information Technology course because it offered as a fully online course.
            As I work full-time, this was the most suited study option for me. The other great benefit of RMIT for me, it that RMIT is based in Melbourne and therefore in the same time zone as myself.
            I could also attend at RMIT on occasion should it be necessary at any point throughout the course.</p>

          <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
          <p>I hope to learn about different programming languages as well as learning about the large range of areas which IT could take me.
            I have not done a lot of research into which areas may interest me most, however I like the idea of being a software engineer.
            I like the idea that IT is world-wide and a degree that could take me around the world or at least let me be employed but be able to do that work from anywhere.</p>

          <h4>A description in own words of the position and appeal of the job</h4>
          <p>This is a high-level software position, working with a large team and even larger client base. Based on the requirements and skills that they are looking for;
            an applicant must have knowledge and experience in various web development languages. The main appeal of this employment is the possibility of a very significant annual salary,
            along with the fast-paced environment. The position is also appealing in that it does not seem like a position that would become repetitive or boring.</p>

          <h4>Description in own words of the skills, quals & experience required</h4>
          <p>Need to be able to effectively code in various web development languages, communicate proficiently and effectively, as well as being able to work unsupervised and work
            at a fast-pace whilst also being accurate in the work undertaken. Qualifications listed are a degree in Computer Science/Engineering, however I believe with the correct
            experience any computer or information technology degree would be sufficient. Given the large range of web development languages the employer is requesting, experience in all
            of these along with years of employment in similar low-level positions would be required. </p>

          <h4>Description in own words of the skills, quals & experience I have</h4>
          <p>I have almost no skills, just the very basics of Java and now HTML. I have no qualifications that would be related to this job. I have experience in a fast-paced work environment,
            working with a large range of clientele, working with important deadlines and completing work at a high level. </p>

          <h4>A plan of how I will obtain the skills, quals & experience required - brief</h4>
          <p>Firstly, finish my Bachelor of Information Technology. Secondly, start gaining experience in the IT world, preferably by gaining a junior IT role about half way through my Bachelor.
            Then build up my skills and experience and the beginning of a portfolio. </p>

      <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
      <p>A Logistician personality is very results driven as well as a perfectionist. A Logistician is someone who focuses on what they know to be true rather than what they feel or believe may be right.
        Kinesthetic learners are able to learn best by completing tasks themselves rather than reading or hearing about the tasks they need to learn.
        Being a prioritiser and arranger coincides with the Logistician personality as a Logistician needs to have a clearly set plan and does not handle unexpected changes very well.</p>

      <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
      <p>I may take over the team and be overbearing when it comes to deadlines and meeting arrangements. I like to have a set schedule or plan to work towards when beginning a project.
        I do not take direct criticism very well and if I believe that I have a great idea, I will push back if challenged or told that I am doing the wrong thing.
        At times though, I can go the complete opposite and I am happy to sit back and let the team make all of the decisions, this plays into the perfectionist part and if I do not
        have an idea which I believe to be perfect then I do not want to proceed with it. </p>

      <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
      <p>I will take this into account when working with my team by not forcing my ideas and opinions on people from the beginning but rather to hear out the whole teams’ ideas first.
        In the alternative, if I do not have any ideas, I will try and elaborate on someone else’s idea and make suggestions as to how we could use or grow that idea to suit our tasks.
        Also, if I find myself in a position where I don’t have any ideas, I will try to help more with the organisation of the team and allocation of the tasks.  </p>


      <!-- Project Idea Section -->
        <section id="Project Idea">
        <header class="sectionHeading">
          <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        </header>


        <p>My project idea is pressure-sensor pad (“pad”) for any replenishable item, whether that be in the fridge, the pantry or cleaning cupboard.
          The idea is to create pads that connect to a mobile app on your phone which allows the user to access the mobile app whilst out of the house and see which items they may need to purchase.</p>

        <p>I can never remember what I have in the house in the way of milk, bread, toilet paper and other replenishable items. Every time I go to the supermarket on my way home from work, or friends’
          places or elsewhere, I find myself calling my dad or brother find out if we need anything. If I can’t get one of them on the phone, I find that I regularly forget something and need to go back
          to the supermarket either that night if it is required for dinner preparation or I go the next day if it’s not so urgent. Given the current COVID-19 situation, going to the supermarket
          regularly is not ideal. Also given the current COVID-19 situation, easily finding statistics on how often people are attending the supermarket and forgetting items is difficult as supermarket
          related statistics are in relation to COVID-19 and the hysteria when supermarkets were being all but raided. I believe this is one of those problems where if it’s relevant to me, it could be
          relevant to many.</p>

        <p>My idea for the pads would be to use the pads along with a linked mobile app. The pads will be able to sense the weight of the item in which is placed on it. The pad will be able to
          transmit this information to the mobile app.</p>

        <p>The pads would need to be small and compact but accurate when measuring the weight of the item placed on it. When conducting some research on how this would be possible, I came across
           an article from 2016 where a prototype was created in relation to this exact idea. Information in relation to the prototype can be found here:
           <a href="http://www.monohelixlabs.com/building-smart-fridge-weight-scale.html">“Building a Smart Fridge Weight Scale” by Paula Petcu.</a> The prototype that was made is a pad with bulky
           wires and a separate battery plugged in. </p>

        <p>Ideally the mobile app will have association with the online catalogues of supermarkets. The four biggest supermarkets, being Coles, Woolworths, ALDI and IGA all have online catalogues
          and online ordering services. These four supermarkets make up 84.3%  of the industry. If the app was to be linked with all four catalogues, I believe this would make the pads more marketable
           to the majority of the country.</p>

        <p>The mobile app will require user input in the form of identifying the item which is placed on it with as much accuracy as possible. By having the catalogues linked to the app,
          the user will be able to select the items in which they usually purchase to give the most accuracy of the items weight. The mobile app will also include a shopping list. This will
          include a list of all items which the user has input and a subsequent automated shopping list that users can access from anywhere. </p>

        <p>There are already scales which are linked with a mobile app. These scales are predominately used for fitness. They tell the user not only their weight but also other information
          in relation to body fat percentage, muscle mass, BMI and many other things. These scales and the associated mobile apps could be adapted to the use being proposing here.</p>

        <p>The biggest obstacle I envisage is not actually in relation to the pads or the mobile app but in relation to the batteries used. Batteries do not perform very well in the cold
          and therefore there will be difficulties found when keeping the pads in the fridge. </p>

        <p>Another obstacle which could hinder this product is that the user may find that keeping items in the exact same spot to be tedious and the pads will need for the items to be
           placed precisely on them and centered to produce the most accurate results.</p>

        <p>In relation to the hardware needed to complete this project, I will refer you to
          <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Build-Arduino-Weighing-Scales/#:~:text=%20How%20to%20Build%20Arduino%20Weighing%20Scales%20,have%20to%20wire%20them%20us%20together...%20More%20">
          “How to Build Arduino Weighing Scales” by p_leriche.</a> In this article there is a range of products that they have used to build a digital scale. In terms of software, this will need a lot more
          research as each mobile app is different and the software needed for this project is currently out of my range of knowledge. Kogan have a smart weighing scale which connects to their mobile app
          Kogan SmarterHome app. Investigating how this scale and mobile app work together would be an ideal starting point. </p>

          <p>In order to create this project, an Application Developer would be needed to write the mobile app. They may need extensive experience to incorporate all parts of the mobile app together
            however I believe this should be fairly straight forward for someone with the knowledge to do so. To construct the pads, someone who is an electrical and mechanical technician would be
            able to put these together. The hardest part will be making the two talk to each other, however with some investigation into how smart watches and phones connect we would be able to find
            this out. </p>

          <p>If this project was to succeed, it would mean less trips to the supermarket as you will always be able to grab the items which you need the first time you go. For the amount of effort
            and time required to create this project it may not be feasible in the long run to combat the simple issue at hand. The mobile app will need to be marketed at a very low cost or for free
            as users may not see the sense in paying for such a mobile app. Supermarkets may not be supportive of such a project as the more times someone attends the supermarket, the more opportunity
            the supermarket has for advertising and for impulse purchases by customers.</p>
